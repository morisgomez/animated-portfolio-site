# Animated-Portfolio-Site
This is a minimalistic designed static portfolio I created. It displays some of my work and a little about myself. CSS animations were used to increase user engagement.

Detailed Summary:
This a portfolio I built from scratch with only HTML and CSS. I went for a minimalistic design to make the site user friendly. Minor CSS animations were utilized. The project is also hosted via Netlify at https://morisportfolio.netlify.app
